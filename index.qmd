I am a postdoctoral fellow at **Emory University,** studying how we process and conceptualize different types of emotional experiences.

I use primarily **R** for my own data analysis and teach R so others might use it as well.

Welcome to my [`quarto`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! Please take a look around.
