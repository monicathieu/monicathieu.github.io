I am a postdoctoral fellow in cognitive neuroscience at **Emory University,** studying how perceptual and conceptual information contribute to emotional experiences.

I use primarily **R** for my own data analysis and teach R so others might use it as well.

Welcome to my [`quarto`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! Please take a look around.
